                <h2>Who Was Alan Turing?</h2>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Alan Turing, in full Alan Mathison Turing, (born June 23, 1912, London, England&mdash;died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire), British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology and also to the new areas later named computer science, cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and artificial life.</p>                  
                    <p>The son of a civil servant, Turing was educated at a top private school. He entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. After graduating in 1934, he was elected to a fellowship at King&rsquo;s College (his college since 1931) in recognition of his research in probability theory. In 1936 Turing&rsquo;s seminal paper &ldquo;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem [Decision Problem]&rdquo; was recommended for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church, who had himself just published a paper that reached the same conclusion as Turing&rsquo;s, although by a different method. Turing&rsquo;s method (but not so much Church&rsquo;s) had profound significance for the emerging science of computing. Later that year Turing moved to Princeton University to study for a Ph.D. in mathematical logic under Church&rsquo;s direction (completed in 1938).</p>

                <h2>The Entscheidungsproblem.</h2>
                <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>What mathematicians called an &ldquo;effective&rdquo; method for solving a problem was simply one that could be carried by a human mathematical clerk working by rote. In Turing&rsquo;s time, those rote-workers were in fact called &ldquo;computers,&rdquo; and human computers carried out some aspects of the work later done by electronic computers. The Entscheidungsproblem sought an effective method for solving the fundamental mathematical problem of determining exactly which mathematical statements are provable within a given formal mathematical system and which are not. A method for determining this is called a decision method. In 1936 Turing and Church independently showed that, in general, the Entscheidungsproblem problem has no resolution, proving that no consistent formal system of arithmetic has an effective decision method. In fact, Turing and Church showed that even some purely logical systems, considerably weaker than arithmetic, have no effective decision method. This result and others&mdash;notably mathematician-logician Kurt G&ouml;del&rsquo;s incompleteness results&mdash;dashed the hopes, held by some mathematicians, of discovering a formal system that would reduce the whole of mathematics to methods that (human) computers could carry out. It was in the course of his work on the Entscheidungsproblem that Turing invented the universal Turing machine, an abstract computing machine that encapsulates the fundamental logical principles of the digital computer.</p>
                    <p>An important step in Turing&rsquo;s argument about the Entscheidungsproblem was the claim, now called the Church-Turing thesis, that everything humanly computable can also be computed by the universal Turing machine. The claim is important because it marks out the limits of human computation. Church in his work used instead the thesis that all human-computable functions are identical to what he called lambda-definable functions (functions on the positive integers whose values can be calculated by a process of repeated substitution). Turing showed in 1936 that Church&rsquo;s thesis was equivalent to his own, by proving that every lambda-definable function is computable by the universal Turing machine and vice versa. In a review of Turing&rsquo;s work, Church acknowledged the superiority of Turing&rsquo;s formulation of the thesis over his own (which made no reference to computing machinery), saying that the concept of computability by a Turing machine &ldquo;has the advantage of making the identification with effectiveness&#8230;evident immediately.&rdquo;</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Having returned from the United States to his fellowship at King&rsquo;s College in the summer of 1938, Turing went on to join the Government Code and Cypher School, and, at the outbreak of war with Germany in September 1939, he moved to the organization&rsquo;s wartime headquarters at Bletchley Park, Buckinghamshire. A few weeks previously, the Polish government had given Britain and France details of the Polish successes against Enigma, the principal cipher machine used by the German military to encrypt radio communications. As early as 1932, a small team of Polish mathematician-cryptanalysts, led by Marian Rejewski, had succeeded in deducing the internal wiring of Enigma, and by 1938 Rejewski&rsquo;s team had devised a code-breaking machine they called the Bomba (the Polish word for a type of ice cream). The Bomba depended for its success on German operating procedures, and a change in those procedures in May 1940 rendered the Bomba useless. During the autumn of 1939 and the spring of 1940, Turing and others designed a related, but very different, code-breaking machine known as the Bombe. For the rest of the war, Bombes supplied the Allies with large quantities of military intelligence. By early 1942 the cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park were decoding about 39,000 intercepted messages each month, a figure that rose subsequently to more than 84,000 per month&mdash;two messages every minute, day and night. In 1942 Turing also devised the first systematic method for breaking messages encrypted by the sophisticated German cipher machine that the British called &ldquo;Tunny.&rdquo; At the end of the war, Turing was made an Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his code-breaking work.</p>

                <h2>How did he die?</h2>
                <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>In the midst of this groundbreaking work, Turing was discovered dead in his bed, poisoned by cyanide. The official verdict was suicide, but no motive was established at the 1954 inquest. His death is often attributed to the hormone 'treatment' he received at the hands of the authorities, following his trial for being gay. Yet he died more than a year after the hormone doses had ended; and, in any case, the resilient Turing had borne this cruel treatment with what his close friend Peter Hilton called 'amused fortitude'. The suicide verdict is now seriously challenged. To judge by the records of the inquest, no evidence at all was presented to indicate that Turing intended to take his own life, nor that the balance of his mind was disturbed (as the coroner claimed). In fact, his mental state appears to have been unremarkable at the time. While suicide cannot be ruled out, it is also possible that Turing's death was simply an accident, the result of his inhaling cyanide fumes from an experiment in the tiny laboratory adjoining his bedroom. Nor can murder by the secret services be entirely ruled out, given that Turing knew so much about Allied cryptanalysis at a time when homosexuals were regarded as a threat to national security.</p>

                    <p>By the 21st century, Turing's prosecution for being gay had become infamous. In 2009, the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown, speaking on behalf of the British government, publicly apologized for Turing's 'utterly unfair' treatment. Four years later, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a Royal pardon.</p>

                    <p>Turing's was a far-&#8203;sighted genius and his research had remarkable breadth, ranging over mathematics and the foundations of mathematics, mathematical logic, cryptanalysis, computer design, mechanical methods in mathematics, the nature of intelligence and mind, and the mechanisms of biological growth. His work is united by an overarching theme -&#8203;his enquiry into (as Max Newman put it) 'the extent and the limitations of mechanistic explanations'.</p>
